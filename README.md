###  🔬 What I learned

In this project, I reinforced my knowledge of responsive design using only HTML & CSS. Some key takeaways include:

-  **HTML Semantics:** I deepened my understanding of semantic elements, particularly the `<picture>` and `<source>` elements. These allow for more responsive images, serving different image formats or resolutions based on the user's device.

-  **CSS for Responsive Layouts:** I practiced structuring layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience.

This project helped me improve my ability to create well-structured, adaptable components while exploring new HTML features for better image optimization.
